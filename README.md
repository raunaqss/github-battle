# Github Battle

## Example react project for the React Fundamentals course on ReactTraining.com

### Updated for React v15.5 warning's for future deprecations and React Router v4

The course instructor Tyler Mcginnis implements this project through the videos, this is my implementation of the same.

To test this on your machine:
- Clone reository
- Go to repository's root directory
- Use command `npm install` to install all dependencies (react, webpack, et cetera)
- Enter command `npm run start` to open the project on `localhost:8080`
